<p>Unity is one of the most popular and easily accessible game engines to date. Which has lead it to become of the best documented and beginner friendly games engines. It can be used to create both 2D and 3D games, and uses C# as itâ€™s main scripting language. And the best part is that every part of it is completely free.

<p>To understand Unity, you need to first understand the differences between a library and a engine. A library is something to that you use to build your application, whereas a engine is something that only calls your code.</p>

<p>Unity is an engine, it is something that you have to understand and use in your pursuit to make a game. You do not get to decide on how the physics engine works or how the lighting effects work. You are just given a number of ways to use the sub systems that were created for you.</p>

<p>When you create anything in unity your making a object. Every object in unity has certain properties attached to it, like its position and scale. You can add other components to it like a particle emitter or sprite render. The way you start coding your game is by way of using scripts that you attach to the object like any other component. Once the script is attached you can then start manipulating the different attributes your game object has.</p>
