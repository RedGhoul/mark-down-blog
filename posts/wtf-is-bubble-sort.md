<p>Bubble sort is a type of sorting algorithm. Its not the best for everything but it does have its uses. It gets its name since it makes the largest values “bubble” to the top. Bubble sort does its job by using pair comparisons. So it takes the current value and compares it to it’s neighbor directly to the right.</p>

<p>Below you can see what I mean. We first take 5 and compare it 3, then ask the question “is 5 greater then 3&nbsp;? “ Then if it is, 5 switches places with 3 and if it isn’t then they stay in the same place, and move on to the next value.</p>

<p>Here you can see a non optimized implementation of it:</p>
